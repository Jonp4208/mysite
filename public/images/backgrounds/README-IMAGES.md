# Background Images Needed

The following optimized background images need to be added to this directory:

## Design Workspace Images
- `/images/backgrounds/design-workspace-1.jpg`
- `/images/backgrounds/design-workspace-2.jpg`
- `/images/backgrounds/design-workspace-3.jpg`

## Business Images
- `/images/backgrounds/business-1.jpg`

## Web Design Images
- `/images/backgrounds/web-design-1.jpg`
- `/images/backgrounds/web-design-2.jpg`

## Calhoun, Georgia Images
- `/images/calhoun/downtown-calhoun.jpg`
- `/images/calhoun/harris-arts-center.jpg`
- `/images/calhoun/gem-theatre.jpg`
- `/images/calhoun/calhoun-skyline.png` (silhouette)

## Image Specifications
- All images should be optimized for web (compressed)
- Recommended size: 1600x900px
- File format: JPG (PNG for silhouette)
- Images should be properly licensed or owned by the site owner

You can source these images from:
1. Professional photography of Calhoun landmarks
2. Licensed stock photography
3. Your own photography collection

For testing purposes, you can use placeholder services or Unsplash, but for production, it's recommended to use properly licensed images specific to Calhoun.
